# Policies Catalogue
A Linked Data catalogue of policies (licenses, laws etc.) presented as Policies according to the [ODRL Information Model 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/).

This catalogue is a website tool to allow people to find policies according to certain criteria and is also a policy writing tool; with it you can author both new abstract policies and also specific implementations of policies for particular purposes.

The technology used is Python Flask - a bare-bones HTTP framework - configured as a simple Model-View-Controller application with the application data being stored in SQLite. Data from the database will also be available as RDF data in a future release.

Further project documentation is in the [_docs/](_docs/) folder of this repository.
